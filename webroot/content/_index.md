This is an experimental website, documenting community conventions in the use of W3C [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-ldn-20170502/) (LDN) to integrate repository systems with relevant services in a distributed, resilient and web-native architecture.

The documentation has the following structure:

**Scenarios:**
These describe an operation, typically involving a repository system and one other service. The operation is enabled by the exchange of *notifications*.

**Notification Pattern**
These describe the payload for a re-usable notification - a kind of template.

**Notifications:**
These describe the individual LDNs sent between repositories and services, one or more of which may be used in a *scenario*.
A given *notification* is defined in the context of a *scenario*, and uses a *pattern*.
